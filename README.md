I am a PhD Candidate at Oden Institute for Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin, where I am advised by Patrick Heimbach. As a member of the [Computational Research in Ice and Ocean Systems (CRIOS) group]([url](https://crios-ut.github.io/)), my research concerns data assimilation and uncertainty quantification with specific focus on the role of subsea cable observing systems in constraining ocean general circulation models.
